   <p class="paragraphs"> <H></H>ello. My name is William White and I am in the 9th grade. I go to <br>
   Shasta. I have gone to New York, Philidelphia, Nevada, Michigan, and Oklahoma. Some things <br>
   about me are I love sports and I like history class. I have two siblings; a brother and a <br>
   sister. My brother is 27 years old and my sister is 8 years old. Two of my favorite sports <br>
   are Football and Basketball. Some of my hobbies include playing sports, skateboarding, and fishing.<br>
   I have just recently started skateboarding, but I have been fishing and playing sports for a<br>
   very long time. Those things are very fun to do because I have been doing them for a long time
   and they can be very challenging at times. When ever I have a good challenge that isn't impossible <br>
   it makes things really fun for me. I have been bored lately so I started skating to not be as bored. <br>
   What I thought would be a little fun activity to do on the side of school came to be very fun and enjoyable.

    <h2> HTML </h2>
    
    <p> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<br> This is the standard markup language<br> to create webpages. 
    Tim Berners-Lee created<br> the HTML in 1879. HTML is very popular and is very impotant.
     
    </p>
    
   <h2> CSS </h2>
   
   <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br> 
   The CSS is the main part for all of the fancy <br>colors and fonts that you see on a page; <br>
   hint the name has style in it. HÃ¥kon Wium Lie <br>first proposed the CSS on October 10, 1994 <br>
   and he was working with the creator of HTML at CERN. <br> </p>
   
   <h2> How do tags work?</h2>
   
   <p> Tags are very impotant, more than you would think.<br> They open and close parts and they explain to 
   the computer<br> on how to format the page that it will be displayed on. For all <br>tags you need openers and 
   closers so the computer won't get confused.</p>
   
   <h2> What are attributes and how do they work?</h2>

<p> Attributes provide additional information about HTML<br> elements. HtML elements can have elements. 
Attributes<br> are always specified in the start tag. Attributes<br> come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
</p>

   <h2> Different tags</h2> 
    
  <p> The following are tags </p>
     
     <ul> 
  <li> Heading tags such as h1 h2 h3 and so on to h6. </li>
  <li> The paragraph tag </li>
  <li> Line break tag </li>
  <li> Horizontal lines </li>
     </ul>
